<heading>Count lines
Count the number of lines on standard input.
<p>
A straightforward solution:
<p>
<source examples/line_count.0.py>
<p>
Or we can read input into a list and use the list length:
<p>
<source examples/line_count.1.py>
<p>
Or more succintly:
<p>
<source examples/line_count.2.py>

<heading>/usr/bin/cp 
Implementations of /bin/cp in Python.
<p>
Simple line by line copying:

<p>
A with statement is better pratice in general
as it ensures file is closed

Reading entire file into an array:
<p>
<source examples/cp.2.py>
<p>
Passing file iterator to writelines

<heading>Print nth-word on every line
Authors sometimes hide secret messages on a particular (e.g first) word
of every line of a text,

This script prints the nth-word on every line of its input files/stdin.
<p>
Note use of the external program fmt to make the output easier to read.
<p>
<source examples/nth_word.py>
<p> 
For example:
<p>
<ssession>
% cd /home/cs2041/public_html/lec/python/examples
% nth_word.py 9 dracula.txt 
on train I through as the which Turkish
nightfall Royale.  with recipe called

<heading>Sorting on the basis of a dict value
Sorting days of the weeks using a dict.
<p>
<source examples/sort_days0.py>
<p> 
For example:
<p>
<ssession>
% cd /home/cs2041/public_html/lec/python/examples
% sort_dates0.py
random_days =  Friday,Thursday,Monday,Sunday,Sunday
sorted_days =  Sunday,Sunday,Monday,Thursday,Friday
</ssession>
<p>
And here is a more concise version.
<p>
Note use of split,zip and dict  to create the same dict as in the above example.
<p>
Also note use of lambda to get the sorting key.
