f you have CVS installed on your system then you may obtain a snapshot of the latest source by performing the following commands. The commands will log you in and check out a copy of the sox module and place it in the subdirectory it was ran from.

 cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@sox.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sox login
 cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@sox.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/sox co sox

The anonymous CVS account does not need a password. When prompted for a password by the cvs command, enter nothing and hit Enter.

To merge in future updates you may run the following command (when ran inside the sox directory that was created from your checkout):

 cvs update

If you make any changes to SoX that you would like to be included in future releases then you may use the following command to make an easy to read diff.

 cvs diff -uw
