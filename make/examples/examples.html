Basic <a href="Makefile.simple">Makefile.simple</a> for game program,
with explicit build for each component object file
and final application executable.

<P><LI>
Basic <a href="Makefile.variables">Makefile.variables</a> for game program,
as above but including some variable definitions


<P><LI>
Basic <a href="Makefile.builtin_variables">Makefile.builtin_variables</a> for game program,
as above but using some builtin variable definitions

<P><LI>
<a href="Makefile.implicit">Makefile.implicit</a> for game program,
as above but relying on implicit rules and special variables
<pre>
make -f Makefile.1
</pre>


<P><LI>
A simple version of make can be written in Perl.
<a href="make0.pl">make0.pl</a>
It can handle the first <a href="Makefile.simple">Makefile.simple</a> because it doesn't
use comments or variables.

<P><LI>

By adding a few more lines of Perl:
<a href="make1.pl">make1.pl</a>
it can handle comments & variables, e.g. <a href="Makefile.variables">Makefile.variables</a>,
but it doesn't implement built-in rules and special variables.
</OL>

<P><LI>

By adding a few more lines of Perl:
<a href="make2.pl">make2.pl</a>
can handle some  builtin variables ($@,$*,$^,$<) 
and implicit rule (.o files).
allowing it to handle <a href="Makefile.builtin_variables">Makefile.builtin_variables</a> and 
<a href="Makefile.implicit">Makefile.implicit</a>.
